Issues in version v1.9.18

Android Phone app Issues
------------------------

The "Your Name" label on idle screen is corrupted, move it lower (more
while space at top of screen)

On idle screen show "Your Name" and the event (event name and ID)

Do not show "Server Address" or "Server Port", those should only be on
the settings page.

also show a web link "Live Tracking: https://wstracker.org/event.html?eid=2" with the
URL derived from the server in settings and the selected event ID

why does it spend so much time in "connecting ..." state on starting
tracking? Is it waiting for better GPS lock? If that is the issue it
should be showing "waiting for GPS"

iPhone app issues
-----------------

should not auto-start tracking when app opened

On idle screen show "Your Name" and the event (event name and ID)

Do not show "Server Address" or "Server Port", those should only be on
the settings page.

also show a web link "Live Tracking: https://wstracker.org/event.html?eid=2" with the
URL derived from the server in settings and the selected event ID

Apple Watch App Issues
----------------------

On idle screen show same basic layout as when tracking.

Top row of text when idle should be red STOPPED

Below that should be the event name

below that should be user name and either 1Hz or 0.1Hz

below that speed and kts
below that heartbeat (if enabled) and distance (as for tracking
screen). Distance should be 0 when not tracking

remove the percentage ack line completely, we will instead change the
color of the "TRACKING" line at the top. Colors should be:

 - red: not tracking
 - green: when we have had an ack in the last 30s
 - orange: when last ack was between 30s and 1 minute
 - red: when no ack for more than 1 minute

remove the "tap to stop" line completely

In settings the top item should be "Your Name" then below that the
password (not hidden) then the event, then the role, then 1Hz mode,
heart rate, tracking buzz and race timer. Server should be last item

within race timer allow the g-force of the tap to start/reset be
settable in units of 1-g (9.81 m/s/s), mininum 2g, maximum 9g, default
3g (measured as vector length over 1g).

In the speech output for the race timer can we preload the speech? It
has a long delay.

remove the start timer button when tracking and race timer enabled,
will only be triggered by action button (if available) or g-force

when start timer enabled and waiting activation replace the speed
display with a stopwatch symbol followed by the time in
mins:secs. When timer is running show remaining time. After timer is
expired go back to displaying speed until a reset is done. After reset
is done go back to displaying stopwatch and time.

is there a way to show the remaining time in the start timer on the
clock screen you get when the watch is idle or locked?


Wearos Watch App Issues
-----------------------

remove the percentage ack line completely, we will instead change the
color of the "TRACKING" line at the top. Colors should be:

 - red: not tracking

 - orange: when last ack was between 30s and 1 minute
 - red: when no ack for more than 1 minute

remove the "tap to stop/start" line completely

is done go back to displaying stopwatch and time.

is there a way to show the remaining time in the start timer on the
clock screen you get when the watch is idle or locked? maybe by
registering a "complication" the user can select?
