ensure apple watch app is sending the special "stop" JSON when
tracking is stopped by the user

add screen complications

android
-------

show event name and eid on idle screen, not just eid

add white space above the top line of tracking screen (corrupted text)

make settings screen scrollable, bottom row is cut off

still takes a long time to start tracking. Maybe it doesn't try to
send until 10s have passed? should send first pkt as soon as GPS lock
available

settings shown on idle screen should not be editable, just info
display

iPhone
------
